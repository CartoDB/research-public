# SDSC20. Integrating CARTOframes into Spatial Data Science workflows

October 21st 2020

Giulia Carella (giulia@carto.com) & Miguel √Ålvarez (malvarez@carto.com)

CARTOframes is our Python package for integrating CARTO maps, analyses, and data services into data science workflows. This workshop will give an introduction to all CARTOframe's functionality through two real-world use cases. You will learn to manage and visualise data, use data services such as geocoding and isochrones, enrich your data with CARTO's Data Observatory datasets, and publish and share your findings. All while working with Jupyter notebooks!

This repository contains the material for the workshop *Integrating CARTOframes into Spatial Data Science workflows*. It includes:

- A deck with the slides used during the workshop
- Two jupyter notebooks used for the practical session (links to satic previews can be found below)

## Installation requirements

If you'd like to run the notebooks, please follow the instructions below. The workshop can also be followed using the notebook static views linked below in step 4.

1. Download or clone this repository. To download the repository click the **Code** button and **Download ZIP**. Otherwise, if you have git installed, you can clone it.

  ```bash
  $ git clone git@github.com:CartoDB/research-public.git
  ```
  
2. Install python (follow instructions here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and jupyter (follow instructions here: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

3. Open your terminal, go to **scsc20-workshop-cartoframes** and run 
  ```bash
  $ jupyter notebook
  ```

4. This will open a new window in your browser, where you will see two jupyter notebooks for the practical session

	- `demo1-site_planning/site_planning.ipynb`. Where should Starbucks open new coffee shops in Long Island, NY? In this demo we will go through a typical site selection use case, from modelling the revenues of the existing stores as a function of socioeconomic covariates, to predicting the potential revenues in new locations.  

	- `demo2-optimization/logistics_optimization.ipynb`. Where should a parcel delivery company locate their distribution and fulfilment centers? What areas should they service? In this demo we will go through a supply chain network optimization use case, from analysing past data to identifying spatio-temporal patterns to building an optimization model to analyze and quantify the impact of changes in the current network.

### CARTO account

**Note** that the analyses we'll work on use data from CARTO's [Data Observatory](https://carto.com/spatial-data-catalog/). In order to run them, a CARTO account is needed. You can [create a free CARTO account](https://carto.com/signup) and experience CARTO's tech stack firsthand for 12 months. You can also follow the workshop using the static previews linked above.

Once you have a CARTO account

1. Go to https://carto.com/login

2. Enter your username and password and click Log In. You will be prompted to your CARTO dashboard

3. Click on the icon on the top right corner, and then on API Keys to visualize your Master Key. To run the demos during the practical session you will only need your username and API Key. For more details, please check this video
