    "# Calculating Routes at Scale using SQL on BigQuery\n",

    "SDSC21 Workshop - Unlocking Spatial Analytics in the cloud with CARTO\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing origin-destination matrices and the corresponding routes is essential for solving key challenges in many sectors such as logistics and transportation, e-commerce and quick commerce, urban mobility/micromobility (car, scooter, and bike sharing), and even for investors in road network infrastructure or insurance companies and public authorities for road safety analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the use case, one might be interested in the shortest, fastest, safest, or even the least polluting route. In addition, as our economy gets more complex and dynamic, so does the need for solutions that scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we present [CARTO's Analytics Toolbox](https://docs.carto.com/analytics-toolbox-bq/overview/getting-started/) functionality for [calculating routes at Scale on BigQuery](https://docs.carto.com/analytics-toolbox-bq/sql-reference/routing/). In particular, we will analyze how people in NYC moved on Thanksgiving 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we will do\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will walk you through all the steps required for calculating routes at scale using [CARTO's Analytics Toolbox](https://docs.carto.com/analytics-toolbox-bq/overview/getting-started/) for BigQuery.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this workshop you will know how to:\n",
    " - Visualize trip data using [spatial indices](https://docs.carto.com/analytics-toolbox-bq/overview/spatial-indexes/)\n",
    " - Generate a compacted network preserving distances\n",
    " - Calculate routes\n",
    " - Calculate road segment use frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "For showcasing this, we will use the following two datasets which are publicly available in BigQuery:\n",
    " - NYC yellow taxi trips from 2015: `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2015`\n",
    " - OSM road network: `bigquery-public-data.geo_openstreetmap.planet_ways`\n",

    "\n",
    "The first step is to source the required data. For routing, there are mainly two sources of information required. \n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we need the **road network** over which we will compute routes and distances. [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/40.7462/-73.9468) data is a fantastic option for this, as it’s freely available in BigQuery. In particular, we are going to use the `bigquery-public-data:geo_openstreetmap.planet_ways` table where public roads are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, we need a set of point location pairs to use as start and end points to compute distances. In order to have an open dataset, we decided to use NYC yellow taxi trips in 2015 for which there are more than 100M trips. They are publicly available in BigQuery under the name `bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_yellow_trips_2015`."

This function generates a network graph from an aggregation of LineStrings and their corresponding speed. The resulting network is based on a compacted geometry of the linestring collection where all nodes with only two links are dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will select as our study area the five counties of NYC. For the county geometries we use BigQuery public dataset `bigquery-public-data.geo_us_boundaries.counties`.\n",

    "In addition, we can specify the types of roads we want to consider. In this case, we'll use `motorway`, `trunk`, `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`, `residential`, and `road`. We could also add `cycleways` or `footways`, depending on our use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the calculated network is a simplification of the original one, where distances are preserved. As we can see in the map below, it drastically simplifies the topology whilst ensuring the total path’s lengths are preserved."
